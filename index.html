        <h2>To My Amazing Brother Kebron</h2>
        <p>
          Kb, on your special day, I want you to know how much you mean to me.
          From childhood until now, you've been more than a brother - you've
          been my mentor, my protector, and my best friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          I remember all the times you stood up for me, all the lessons you
          taught me, and all the laughter we've shared. Your guidance has shaped
          who I am today, and I can never thank you enough for that.
        </p>
        <p>
          You've shown me what it means to be strong yet kind, determined yet
          compassionate. Your unwavering support through every challenge has
          been my greatest blessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I celebrate you - not just as my brother, but as the incredible
          man you've become. May this year bring you all the happiness, success,
          and love you deserve.
        </p>
        <p>With all my love and respect,</p>
        <p>Your little brother, Matiüòä.</p>
